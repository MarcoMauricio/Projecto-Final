This folder contains client-side (browser) code for each module.

The application entry is in the Core/Scripts/main.js.
The routing is in Core/Scripts/routes.js

IMPORTANT: While dynamic client-side code loading is not implemented and since angular.js doesn't do 
		   lazy loading of namespaces, please add your custom module namespace to the main.js file. Thanks.
